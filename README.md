# Pharinformation
Pharinformation which is a combination of "Pharmacy" &amp; "Information" is project for our CSC 4710 Database Systemes class. In this project we will have to create and implement a full database based on some information that we can either get from data.gov or create our own dataset. Our database will be based on the pharmacy dataset. We will try to create a similar database that shows how a pharmacy data are reepresented. For example, how drugs, prescriptions, shoots, staff, customer, pharmacist, and etc are all saved and put in a database. Thus, we will also implement a little program coded either in Java or Python that can manipulate our database.
